          <span>01</span> The Principles of Grid Systems
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item grid-item--span-4 article-lead">
          <p>The grid system is the fundamental organizing principle of Swiss Style. It is an invisible, rational
            framework that governs the placement of all elements, creating a powerful sense of order, clarity, and unity
            across the page.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item grid-item--span-8 grid-item--start-5 article-body">
          <p>Born from a fervent desire for objectivity and legibility, the Swiss Style, or International Typographic
            Style, revolutionized graphic design in the mid-20th century. Pioneers like Josef Müller-Brockmann, Armin
            Hofmann, and Max Bill championed a rigid, modular grid-based system. This was not merely an aesthetic
            choice; it was a profound philosophical one. The grid was seen as the ultimate tool for creating impartial,
            universally understandable communication, free from the subjective whims and decorative flourishes of the
            designer. It imposed a strict mathematical logic on the page, ensuring that every headline, paragraph,
            image, and caption had a deliberate and rational place within the whole.</p>
          <p>This rigorous approach results in designs that are exceptionally clean, highly structured, and incredibly
            efficient at conveying complex information. The exclusive use of sans-serif typefaces—most notably
            Helvetica, introduced in 1957, and Univers—further emphasized this unwavering commitment to clarity and
            neutrality. The style's influence is undeniable, and its core principles continue to inform the best of
            contemporary digital and print design, proving that a strong structure is the foundation of true creative
            freedom.</p>

        <div class="grid-item grid-item--span-4 grid-item--start-1 article-body">
          <p>This famous quote by Charles Eames perfectly encapsulates the ethos of Swiss-inspired architecture. The
            focus is on absolute precision, structural honesty, and a deep, unwavering respect for materials. Buildings
            are stripped of all unnecessary ornamentation to reveal their essential form and function. Concrete, steel,
            and glass are not merely building materials; they are expressive elements, used in their raw state to
            celebrate their inherent textures, properties, and beauty.</p>

        <div class="grid-item grid-item--span-8 article-body">
          <p><strong>1. Embrace Constraint:</strong> True creativity flourishes within a system of constraints. The grid
            is not a cage; it is a key that unlocks infinite possibilities within a defined space. By setting clear
            rules, we free ourselves to focus on the content and the message.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Typography is Architecture:</strong> Treat type as a structural element. The choice of typeface,
            its size, weight, and placement, builds the foundation of the page. Asymmetry creates dynamic tension, while
            a clear hierarchy guides the reader's eye with purpose.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Objectivity Over Expression:</strong> The designer's role is that of a neutral conduit for
            information. The goal is clarity, not personal expression. We use photography and typography to present
            information as objectively as possible, allowing the content itself to take center stage.</p>
